# Hardway3
Zed A Shaws python the Hardway. In the interest of challenging myself. I shall port all lessons to python 3.
As an engineer I will make some small changes out side of the general syntax change for porting.
I will usually always declare the interpreter to run. So all you need to do is add the executable bit to the script and you can run it as ./ex2.py etc.

If I have a daft typo in the code let us know.

If you are Zed Shaw. Thank you. If you are not go to his site and support his awesome work http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book
